## Description

This project is a creation of a Weather Dashboard. This Weather Dashboard contains a text box and a button in where you can enter a location and search for it. The main focus of this Weather Dashboard is to allow the user to search for basic weather details on the location selected in the most simple way possible, so the user get an idea in how its looking at that specific place. This page contains one javascript file, one css file and one html file.

The biggest challenge i found was definitly how to work with this API and how to use it in the correct way so i could get the correct display or result i was looking for. Everytime i tried to get the result i wanted something else was happening or an error was happening so that was affecting my confidence levels, and making me go nervous and upset for not being able to solve at first. Another big challenge was definitly working without any starter code that obviusly make me waste a bit more of time to decide the starter point of this work.

This challenge helped me a lot because it boosted my confidence levels since i was able to overcome the issues i was having under high frustration levels. Also made me way more knowledgeable in how to work with this type of JavaScript code and it helped me with some other factors that i will be listing bellow.

* Faster working speed
* Better understanding of JavaScript
* Better use of API
* Better organization 

## Usage

To use this website is pretty easy. You type a location in the box that says (Enter Location) and click on the search button. And after that it should load the Temperature , Wind speed, Humidity and UV Index of the location you searched and also the same details for the 5 day forecast. Then if you decide to search for another location the same action will happen and it will storage what you searched before bellow the enter location, and if you select it, it should load it.
